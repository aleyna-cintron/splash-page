        <p class="text-gray-700 p-8 text-xl sm:p-12 xl:p-20">Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. "The Advancing Giants") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from the gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. ("Attack on Titan - Wikipedia", 2021)</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 p-8 text-xl sm:p-12 xl:p-20"> The reason this is my favorite episode is because one of the most memorable scenes takes place in this episode. There's a huge fight going on between the troops and the most powerful titan. It looks doomed for the troops as they're completely outmatched against the beast titan. They devise a plan to distract the beast titan by marching straight to their deaths towards him as a way to distract him so that their commander can flank him. It's extremely horrifying and sad but also amazing to watch.</p>
